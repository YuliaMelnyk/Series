		Alex Garland Wants to Break Your Brain with the Brilliant Devs
	</title>
<en>The genius behind “Ex Machina” and “Annihilation” brings his brand of highly philosophical and intellectual sci-fi to the new ‘FX on Hulu’ section this week with the stunningly ambitious “Devs,” a great show that’s almost impossible to write about in a review. Like he did in his last two films, Alex Garland unpacks his themes slowly and deliberately, not revealing what “Devs” is primarily about until several episodes in. Not only do we not have a habit on this site of spoiling anything major that happens after a series premiere, but FX has been insistent about not revealing what this show really becomes. All I’ll say is that it’s a daring and new deconstruction of one of the basic tenets of human existence. At times throughout the season, Garland’s tendency to direct actors to affectless, almost monotonous performances will push casual viewers away, but I plead patience here. It’s ultimately an unforgettable and rewarding experience, and one that I really hope people are talking about and writing about once everything has been put on the table.
            Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno, who was Oscar Isaac’s dance partner in “Ex Machina”) is a software engineer at a company called Amaya, run by the mysterious Forest (Nick Offerman). Amaya is like any number of Silicon Valley companies trying to do something that the rest of the competition in the tech sector isn’t even considering. There’s an elite branch of Amaya called “Devs,” and Lily’s boyfriend Sergei (Karl Glusman) is basically promoted to that exclusive department in the premiere. He goes to work in Devs, meeting fellow elites like the mysterious Katie (Alison Pill) and kindly Stewart (Stephen McKinley Henderson), but only after a serious grilling by security head Kenton (Zach Grenier). After his first day in Devs, Sergei disappears, and the show becomes Lily’s story, trying to figure out what exactly happened to her boyfriend and how it's related to what they do in Devs.
            We know the answer to the first question when it happens but the exact nature of the tech research in Devs unfolds slowly, dominating the mystery of the first half of the season. And it does so in a manner that feels more like a ‘70s conspiracy thriller than a traditional sci-fi film. There are covert meetings with dangerous people under bridges and in parking garages, and bursts of shocking violence in “Devs.” Garland has a storytelling model and Lily is cut from the same cloth as Domhnall Gleeson’s character in “Ex Machina” and Natalie Portman’s in “Annihilation,” the observer who then changes what’s being observed. He’s fascinated by human interaction with technology but not in a cold, observant way. There’s a push and pull between individuality and determinism in all of his work, and he digs deep into how systems are shaped by human input, need, and emotion.

            Clearly, there’s a lot to chew on in “Devs,” but some of the performances can feel a bit overly familiar. Offerman gets better but starts the season as a bit of a tech messiah archetype that we’ve seen before. He’s a character meant to hold so many secrets as to his purpose in the first few episodes that his mysterious nature almost tends to parody. Similarly, Mizuno feels like a blank slate early in the season but she’s asked to do a lot in the back half of the year and she ultimately worked for me. What I liked most about the cast of “Devs” is how much Garland chose to work with a very tight ensemble. A lot of creators think high-concept TV means dozens of arcs, subplots, and speaking roles—“Westworld” often fell victim to this—but “Devs” is comparatively focused, allowing Garland, who wrote and directed every episode, to really sketch out each of his speaking roles into interesting characters.
            “Devs” also simply looks better than most modern television, shot by Garland’s regular collaborator Rob Hardy. Working with Garland, they give the show a much warmer, denser color palette than it would have had in other hands. Even the production design of the Devs building fascinated me with its undeniably futuristic look that is also balanced by warm colors, which makes more sense when one learns Forest’s grand plan. It’s that kind of show, one in which design and visual choices were clearly influenced by theme and plot instead of merely functional. It’s a show that’s as constantly surprising in its artistic choices—for example, how an early fight scene is staged is startling—as it is in its narrative. It feels constantly just left-of-center, even when it’s treading familiar sci-fi ground.

            There’s a scene late in the season in which Forest mentions how every generation seems to be speeding up development. For generations, we were happy in caves, painting on the walls. Now, there’s a new way to communicate and comprehend the world every few hours. Alex Garland wants to question and confront what this acceleration means for the human race. And he’s done so with one of the best new shows in a long time.

		'Little Fires Everywhere' Finds Families Ready To Collide
	</title>
<en>The great frustration of Little Fires Everywhere, the Hulu adaptation of Celeste Ng's popular novel, is that of the eight episodes, they only made seven available for review.

            It matters because Little Fires Everywhere is a story of collision. Mia (Kerry Washington) and her daughter Pearl (Lexi Underwood), temporarily living in their car, come to Shaker Heights, Ohio. They collide with the wealthy Elena Richardson (Reese Witherspoon), who has a house to rent. Mia and Pearl become entangled with Elena and her husband and four children, and eventually, even their friends can't avoid each other.
            
            Those who have seen Big Little Lies will recognize Elena as a more malevolent version of the wealthy, driven, status-obsessed mother Witherspoon she plays there. Ohio and not Monterey, and yet recognizably similar. Those who have seen Scandal may even recognize Mia as a much less well-connected version of the driven survivor Washington plays there. Putting the very different energies of these actresses in conversation with each other is a good, promising idea.

            Much of the story also takes place in the complex emotional lives of Elena and Mia's children. In particular, Mia worries over the attachment Pearl quickly forms to the Richardsons, and to their nice big house and their leisure time and their stability. Elena is baffled by her youngest, a budding artist and raw nerve named Izzy (Megan Stott), who gravitates toward Mia, both because she's an artist and because she's almost as skeptical of Elena as Izzy is.

The series doesn't quite feel solid, in part because as it progresses, Elena becomes more unambiguously awful. It's a better show when it feels like two very different mothers with very different cards to play, trying in their own ways to offer the parenting they think is needed. But a plot development involving a co-worker of Mia's and a friend of Elena's winds up unbalancing their relationship. While this creates a certain tension, it's hard to know whether that tension will find any resolution.

But again, this is the frustration: The point is that the first seven episodes build and build the pressure on and among all these characters and the worlds they inhabit. Pearl and Izzy feel rejected by their mothers; Elena and Mia feel pushed away by their daughters. Elena's other daughter Lexi is pushed to confront her own privilege, while her brothers Trip and Moody have different attachments to Pearl and different ways of treating her well and poorly. It builds and builds, and either the series sticks the landing in that last episode and it feels worth the ride, or it doesn't, and it doesn't.

With some series, this feels less important. In some cases, the pleasures of a show are such that there's less of a nagging concern over whether it will successfully tie itself together. But this one feels just unsteady enough that if it doesn't land on a coherent final chord, it won't hold together as a whole. The caliber of performers and the strength of the source material makes me optimistic. But in a series about collision, not getting to see what happens when everything collides makes it hard to feel like you've seen it at all.

		5 Reasons Why You Should Be Watching ‘Dark,’ Netflix’s New Twisty German Time Travel Show
	</title>
<en>  In the era of peak TV, it often feels next to impossible to actually keep up with the shows you
            already watch, much less try to start new ones. I get it. I watch TV for a living and even I
            can’t keep up with as many shows as I would like.

            So with that in mind, I’m gonna pitch you on “Dark,” the extremely heady new time travel show
            that just landed on Netflix. It’s going a bit under the radar right now, sandwiched between “The
            Punisher” and the second season of “The Crown.” Also it’s in German rather than English, which
            may put you off. But having watched its 10-episode first season twice now, I can confirm it’s
            worth your time.

            “Dark” takes us to the small town of Winden, Germany, a place full of fun personal melodrama —
            and also children who have gone missing without a trace. It centers on a handful of families
            that have lived there for a long time and are prominent in the community. The time travel
            conceit does more than give us a window into how these families have evolved over many decades —
            it’s brings a whole new meaning to “things are not quite what they seem here.”
            I’m going to stop there with the description. I’m not usually one to be overly concerned
                about spoilers, but “Dark” is such a weird and twisty thing that It’s tough to talk about it
                much without delving into a place that even I would call spoiler territory. “Dark” is a show
                best discovered with the bare minimum of information about its premise. That being said, I’m
                going to, without spoilers, explain why I like the show below, if you need more
                encouragement.

          1. It’s a little bit “Stranger Things,” a little bit “Twin Peaks,” a little bit “Lost” and a
                whole bunch of doing its own thing

                “Dark” is the kind of show where, early on before you really get to know it, you can feel
                the vibes of shows that came before. The stories that influenced “Dark” are ones that deal
                with people who are wrestling with extra-natural forces that are just beyond their
                understanding. But it’s certainly not a show that wears those influences on its sleeve —
                series creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese have crafted a fiercely original piece of
                fiction that is one of the most thoughtful and unique TV shows of 2017.

           2. It’s one of the rare on-screen time travel stories with airtight time travel logic

                Time travel is hard, OK. It’s inherently illogical and can’t follow the rules of reality as
                we know them in the real world. So the foundation of any good time travel story has to be
                the rules. You can set whatever time travel rules you want, so long as you stick with them —
                if you don’t, the story falls apart. It’s a whole extra thing the writers of a story have to
                deal with, in addition to simply trying to write a good story in the usual sense. So it’s
                easy to mess that up, because it requires basically double the work.
                2. It’s one of the rare on-screen time travel stories with airtight time travel logic

                Time travel is hard, OK. It’s inherently illogical and can’t follow the rules of reality as
                we know them in the real world. So the foundation of any good time travel story has to be
                the rules. You can set whatever time travel rules you want, so long as you stick with them —
                if you don’t, the story falls apart. It’s a whole extra thing the writers of a story have to
                deal with, in addition to simply trying to write a good story in the usual sense. So it’s
                easy to mess that up, because it requires basically double the work.

         
                3. It’s also a super compelling personal drama

                There’s one major character, Ulrich (Oliver Masucci), who I’ve been really fascinated by
                since I watched the series. “Dark” puts Ulrich at the center of things for a while, and
                successfully made me care about him even though he’s really kind of a terrible and not
                particularly likable person the whole way through. What makes him work as a character is how
                truly human he feels, and Ulrich is representative of how Odar and Friese treat all their
                characters. There isn’t a single major character on “Dark” who you can’t empathize with on
                some level, which makes all their myriad interactions and conflicts all the more engrossing.


                4. It uses time travel as a religious metaphor

                Without delving into the particulars, “Dark” takes a sort of existential angle with its time
                travel shenanigans, with characters talking about time as if it were God — and who talk
                about time travel is if it were a means to exert power over God. It’s a fascinatingly weird
                angle for a time travel story, and one that worked like gangbusters on me since I come from
                an extremely religious part of the U.S. That Friese and Odar would even think to take the
                story this way is demonstrative of how “Dark” goes to places you find anywhere else in the
                realm of television this year.

 
                5. It’s just extremely cool looking, with a stellar score to boot

                Aside from simply being an excellent show, “Dark” also manages to be one of the more
                visually striking shows around. It’s up there, in fact, with “Westworld,” the new “Twin
                Peaks,” and “Hannibal.” And it’s got a score to match, simple and booming and dread-fueled.
                “Dark” would probably still be very good were these elements not working on this level, but
                that they do elevates the show into a truly complete package.
